Create a fully deployable, aesthetic Tic Tac Toe game using only a single prompt with the following requirements:

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS — all code delivered in a single file, no frameworks or external dependencies.
- Space-themed styling with stars, nebula, and animated planets as decorative backgrounds.
- The game container uses a glassmorphism effect (blurred, semi-transparent, glowing border).
- Title/header “X&O IN SPACE” has glowing, animated effects.
- 3-column scoreboard showing Player X, Player O, and Draws, with color-coded animated numbers.
- 3x3 grid styled as clickable buttons, displaying a star shape for X and a planet shape for O (both with visual glow/animations).
- Turn indication for X and O, with color and status updates for win/loss/draw.
- Winning row highlights with animation when game ends.
- Replay button resets the board, and Reset All button resets scores plus board.
- Prevent moves on filled squares and after game ends.
- All code must be copy-pasteable as one .html file and ready for deployment on Netlify, Vercel, etc.
- Include concise comments at the top for setup/use.
- Output the code only—no explanations or extra text.
